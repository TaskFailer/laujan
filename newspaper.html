        <p>Novice programmers to struggle putting together as much as a sinlge line of code as in a horrific case of "not knowing how to do something", they don't know what to do!<br><br><i>"It's a modern travesty!"</i> A man dressed in a batman costume told us. <i>"I've seen 15 year olds with more cognitive prowess, in my comic books. They have absolutely no knowledge of how to program, as if they never even heard of the topic."</i> He declared, sadly he left upon being asked the question who he was referring to.
